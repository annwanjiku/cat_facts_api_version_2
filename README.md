# Cat Facts API Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to retrieve and display data, specifically through the "Cat Facts API." The project focuses on practicing API integration and enhancing web development skills by fetching and displaying data in a web interface.

### What’s an API?
An API, or Application Programming Interface, enables us to communicate with external data sources to obtain specific data based on our needs. We use API endpoints to access and filter data as required.

### Cat Facts API
The "Cat Facts API" provides information about cats. You can access it [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1946054/S11HvKSz) to explore and filter data by:
- **Breed**: Information about specific cat breeds.
- **Single or Multiple Facts**: Retrieve one or more cat facts at a time.

### Project Goals
- Practice using APIs to retrieve and display data.
- Improve web development skills through real-time data integration.

### Live Demo
This page is hosted for viewing—try it out to see the API in action.

## Improvements
- Limit the length of facts (e.g., to 50 words or fewer).
- Set a cap on the number of facts displayed per session.
- Enhance the overall visual design.
